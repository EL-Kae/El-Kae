<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Leo üëã</h1>

I am a security professional and Co-Founder/Software Engineer at Applicate Inc. Native New Yorker and retiring digital nomad.

I have experience in developing and securing various tech stacks from programming languages such as python and javascript to hosting environments in the cloud. It's best for a security engineer to understand the tech stack and the developer, to better secure the product. I also have industry standard cyber security certifications CompTIA Security+ and the EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). Currently I'm developing security tools for everyone to use to protect their information and software.
